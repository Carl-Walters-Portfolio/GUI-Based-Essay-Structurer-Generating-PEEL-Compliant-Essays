To run the application, please find app.py.

This application allows you to add multiple individual field entries. After all desired entries have been input, the users can export a text document in which each entry is put together with the corresponding number following each PEEL. This means it is easy to keep track and combine individual PEEL entries.

This is an example of how to fill out each field for an individual PEEL. 
After you have finished filling out a PEEL, click "Format my essay to PEEL". Your entry will be stored and added to a list. All the PEEL fields will then be set back to empty, ready to take the next PEEL entry.

Finally, a list will be produced under each part of PEEL (Point, Evidence, Explanation, and Link). It will contain each entry and its corresponding number so you can keep track of each entry's number, which will remain the same under each part of PEEL, so users are easily able to keep track of individual entries.
